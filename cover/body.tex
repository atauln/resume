I am excited to apply for the role of software engineer at \company. With my expertise in programming languages such as Java, Python and Kotlin, and my passion for working on innovative projects, I am confident that I would be an excellent addition to the \company\ team.

As a software developer, I have spent the past several years honing my skills in software development, and trying out new languages and frameworks in my free time. I have worked on projects ranging from web applications to mobile apps, to audio processing all the way to working with MQTT systems and hardware. Furthermore, my experience with the Computer Science House at RIT has allowed me to remain up-to-date with the latest industry practices. I am particularly interested in data analytics and DevOps, as I have always been drawn towards system administration and database creation (as is reflected by minor in database design).

I am particularly drawn to \company\ due to the company's reputation for innovation and its commitment to using technology in a way that has never been seen before. I am thrilled by the possibility of working on projects that push the boundaries of what is possible.

I believe that my skills and experience make me an excellent candidate for this position at \company. I am eager to contribute my experience to the company and work alongside a team of talented and driven peers. Thank you for considering my application.
